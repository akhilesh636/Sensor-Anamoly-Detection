# Sensor-Anamoly-Detection
Developed a sensor anomaly detection system involves gathering sensor data, processing it with an STM32F4VGT6 microcontroller, and transmitting it to an ESP32 WROOM - E via CAN bus. The ESP32 WROOM - E then communicates with the cloud using MQTT, enabling real-time monitoring and analysis of sensor readings. Additionally, the ESP32 WROOM - E also transmits data to a SPI Screen Module TFT Interface, providing on-site visualization of sensor metrics, further facilitating monitoring and quick decision-making. This project ensures timely detection of anomalies in sensor data, enhancing system reliability and efficiency.
