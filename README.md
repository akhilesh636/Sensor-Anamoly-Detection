# Sensor-Anamoly-Detection
• Sensor anomaly detection system designed
  for real-time monitoring and analysis.
• Utilizes an STM32F4VGT6 microcontroller
  for gathering and processing sensor data.
• Incorporates FreeRTOS for efficient task
  scheduling and management, enhancing
  system robustness and ensuring timely
  processing of sensor data for anomaly
  detection.
• Data transmission facilitated via CAN bus
  to an ESP32 WROOM - E module.
• ESP32 WROOM - E communicates with the
  cloud using MQTT for remote monitoring
  and analysis.
• On-site visualization enabled through a SPI
  Screen Module TFT Interface, displaying
  sensor metrics for quick decision-making.
• To enhance anomaly detection, two rules 
  have been implemented: the z-score
  method and a rule-based approach. 
• These rules complement the real-time
  monitoring and analysis system, ensuring
  comprehensive anomaly detection and
  improving system reliability and efficiency.
• Ensures timely detection of anomalies in
  sensor data, enhancing system reliability
  and efficiency.
